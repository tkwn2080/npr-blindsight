This was initially developed as a testing environment for an object detection model trained on Nepali rupee banknote denominations. The present version is a completed iOS application for this purpose, to be published to the App Store after further testing. 

So far this has been used by a developer in New Zealand to put together their own version for NZD banknotes. It can easily be converted to provide this with any currency, just by training your own model and changing a few variables, etc.
